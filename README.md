# Audiogram-Serverless

Audiogram-Serverless is a ready-to-use serverless lambda for creating shareable audiograms from your voice and srt files. It is inspired by https://github.com/nypublicradio/audiogram. Once deployed to AWS Lambda, this:
* Can generate audiograms in MP4 format from an audio and srt file in AWS s3
* Upload the video file in a video bucket (specified in .env) and return the path
* Can be customized with various themes, fonts and wave patterns
