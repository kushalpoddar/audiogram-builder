1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,588
If your child struggles with math

2
00:00:01,588 --> 00:00:03,150
anxiety, it’s important to

3
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,713
understand what it is. Having an

4
00:00:05,713 --> 00:00:07,163
understanding of their emotional

5
00:00:07,163 --> 00:00:09,613
reactions to math class and/or math

6
00:00:09,613 --> 00:00:11,513
homework can be beneficial to

7
00:00:11,513 --> 00:00:12,813
helping them work through it.

8
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:15,775
Extreme math anxiety is prevalent

9
00:00:15,775 --> 00:00:18,200
in about 2-6% of secondary-school

10
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,900
level children. Less extreme math

11
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,175
anxiety is more common and can also

12
00:00:23,175 --> 00:00:24,813
have a severe negative impact on

13
00:00:24,813 --> 00:00:25,500
your children.

14
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,801
According to the University of

15
00:00:27,801 --> 00:00:29,639
Cambridge Center for Neuroscience

16
00:00:29,639 --> 00:00:32,226
in Education, math anxiety is, “a

17
00:00:32,226 --> 00:00:33,814
negative emotional reaction to

18
00:00:33,814 --> 00:00:35,201
mathematics that can be

19
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:38,251
debilitating”. Math anxiety has

20
00:00:38,251 --> 00:00:39,889
also been defined as “a feeling of

21
00:00:39,889 --> 00:00:42,151
tension and anxiety that interferes

22
00:00:42,151 --> 00:00:43,789
with the manipulation of numbers

23
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:45,289
and the solving of mathematical

24
00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:47,364
problems in … ordinary life and

25
00:00:47,364 --> 00:00:50,326
academic situations”. Someone who

26
00:00:50,326 --> 00:00:52,189
struggles with math anxiety can

27
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:53,714
have a very hard time learning,

28
00:00:53,714 --> 00:00:55,789
practicing and applying math in

29
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:56,839
school and out.

30
00:00:56,839 --> 00:00:59,727
Math anxiety not only affects your

31
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:01,577
children in school, but can also

32
00:01:01,577 --> 00:01:03,052
have an effect on their everyday

33
00:01:03,052 --> 00:01:05,715
lives. Children who struggle with

34
00:01:05,715 --> 00:01:07,890
untreated math anxiety can develop

35
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,277
an avoidance to real-world

36
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:11,027
situations in which anything with

37
00:01:11,027 --> 00:01:14,002
numbers or math is involved. This

38
00:01:14,002 --> 00:01:15,540
can even influence what careers

39
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,515
they choose later on. Math anxiety

40
00:01:18,515 --> 00:01:20,040
has been shown to correlate with

41
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,840
poor performance in math class

42
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,315
which can impact your child’s

43
00:01:23,315 --> 00:01:25,090
overall attitude towards school.

44
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,366
Some signs that your child

45
00:01:27,366 --> 00:01:29,253
struggles with math anxiety can

46
00:01:29,253 --> 00:01:30,628
include negative-self talk

47
00:01:30,628 --> 00:01:32,616
surrounding math, putting off math

48
00:01:32,616 --> 00:01:34,391
work, panic when doing math

49
00:01:34,391 --> 00:01:36,591
homework, and lack of motivation to

50
00:01:36,591 --> 00:01:39,166
work on math. If this sounds like

51
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:41,078
your child, there are ways in which

52
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:42,478
you can help them to overcome their

53
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:43,478
math anxiety.

54
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,979
Encouraging positive self-talk

55
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:47,492
about math is a good place to

56
00:01:47,492 --> 00:01:50,279
start. If your child begins to put

57
00:01:50,279 --> 00:01:51,729
themselves down about their math

58
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:53,579
abilities, attempt to change the

59
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,142
tone of the conversation to a

60
00:01:55,142 --> 00:01:57,867
positive one. Uplifting your child

61
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,629
about their math skills can help to

62
00:01:59,629 --> 00:02:01,317
change their overall attitude about

63
00:02:01,317 --> 00:02:02,730
math.

64
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,518
Another way to help your child is

65
00:02:04,518 --> 00:02:06,330
to schedule times during the week

66
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,005
when they will work on math, either

67
00:02:08,005 --> 00:02:09,693
independently or with the help of a

68
00:02:09,693 --> 00:02:12,730
tutor. Scheduling tutoring sessions

69
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,793
can be an efficient way to ensure

70
00:02:14,793 --> 00:02:16,393
that your child is consistently

71
00:02:16,393 --> 00:02:18,018
practicing their math skills.

72
00:02:18,018 --> 00:02:20,369
Getting organized, having a

73
00:02:20,369 --> 00:02:22,456
schedule, and including extra help

74
00:02:22,456 --> 00:02:24,356
for your child’s math lessons can

75
00:02:24,356 --> 00:02:25,881
have significant effects on their

76
00:02:25,881 --> 00:02:27,869
math anxiety and performance.

77
00:02:27,869 --> 00:02:30,419
Working with a tutor to clear up

78
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:32,656
any confusion before math class or

79
00:02:32,656 --> 00:02:34,569
exams will reduce their anxiety

80
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:35,694
about math greatly.

81
00:02:35,694 --> 00:02:38,495
Online tutoring resources that are

82
00:02:38,495 --> 00:02:40,157
flexible and affordable are

83
00:02:40,157 --> 00:02:41,420
available with Access2Success.

84
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,795
Personalized tutoring plans for

85
00:02:44,795 --> 00:02:46,632
your children’s math curriculum can

86
00:02:46,632 --> 00:02:48,682
reduce their math anxiety, improve

87
00:02:48,682 --> 00:02:50,632
their performance, and facilitate a

88
00:02:50,632 --> 00:02:53,730
positive attitude surrounding math.
